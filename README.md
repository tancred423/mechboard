MechBoard is a mechanic tracking tool designed primarily for Final Fantasy XIV raiders, though it can be adapted for any situation where you need to quickly remember and track multiple options during time-sensitive moments. It is fully customizable so you can build your own encounters, mechanics and their options. It comes with a sync feature so other people can follow along what options you select, so you can remember mechanics that affect the whole group.

## What It Does

During raid encounters, players often need to remember specific mechanics that were shown earlier in the fight. MechBoard provides a simple, clean interface where you can:

- Create encounters for different raid fights or scenarios
- Add mechanics with customizable options (like "Stack" vs "Spread")
- Quickly tap options to mark them as active
- Reset all selections with a single button after a wipe
- Organize encounters into folders for better management
- Sync your encounter with other people in real time to let them see what you click

## Key Features

- **Large, Easy-to-Hit Buttons**: Designed for quick mid-raid interactions without precise mouse movements
- **Single or Multi-Select**: Each mechanic card can be configured for radio-style (one option) or checkbox-style (multiple options) selection
- **Local Storage**: Your encounters are saved in your browser automatically
- **Cloud Sync**: Log in with Discord to sync your encounters across devices
- **Import/Export**: Share your encounters with others via JSON export
- **Dark and Light Mode**: Comfortable viewing in any environment, with automatic system theme detection
- **Compact Mode**: Reduce button sizes for more information density if preferred

2. Add mechanics for each mechanic you want to track
